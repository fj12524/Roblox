<h2>2016</h2>

<h2><br> 2018</h2>
<p><br><strong>
March 2018: </strong>KToH was released to the public with Tower of Hecc being the only Tower. Players, at the time, found Tower of Hecc so hard that they did not plan to beat it, but rather see how far they could get.</p>
<p><br><strong>
July 2018: </strong>KToH started getting popular which inspired Kiddie to make a new Tower called the Tower of Screen Punching.</p>
<p><br><strong>
August 2018: </strong>Tower of Anger and Tower of Madness were both added at the same time, as Tower of Hell was the easiest tower prior to this update. The players finally got to play easier towers and beat them. The game reached 50,000 visits.</p>
<p><br><strong>
September 2018: </strong>A big update cme out, it dded a brand-new lobby, which looks exactly like the current Ring 1 lobby. It introduced a new difficulty, called "???" (which later became Remorseless), a difficulty chart, a colored difficulty and added Tower of Keyboard Yeeting, Tower of Stress, Tower of Rage, and Tower of True Skill.</p>
