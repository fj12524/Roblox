<h2><br> 2018</h2>
<p><br><strong>
March 2018: </strong>KToH was released to the public with Tower of Hecc being the only Tower. Players, at the time, found Tower of Hecc so hard that they did not plan to beat it, but rather see how far they could get.</p>
<p><br><strong>
July 2018: </strong>KToH started getting popular which inspired Kiddie to make a new Tower called the Tower of Screen Punching.</p>
